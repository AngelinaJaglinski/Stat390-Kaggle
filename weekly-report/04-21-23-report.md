### Weekly Report 2: Kaggle Competition
#### 04/21/2023

Progress:
- We decided to focus on the my_chi dataset this week.
- Our group members individually worked on some initial data cleaning and EDA.

Problem:
- We learned that the Kaggle problem is a loan prediction problem so that should help with the problem going forward.

Plan:
- We will work on the Kaggle problem more this coming week.
